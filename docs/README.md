# Getting Started

## Install the package via composer.

```bash
composer require stephenlake/laravel-properties
```

## Register the service provider.

This package makes use of Laravel's auto-discovery of service providers. If you are an using earlier version of Laravel (&lt; 5.4) you will need to manually register the service provider.

Add `Properties\PropertiesServiceProvider::class` to the `providers` array in `config/app.php`.

That's it. See the usage section for examples.
